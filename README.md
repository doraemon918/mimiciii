# mimiciii Crictical Care Hospital Readmission
Analytics Practicum Project at Rutgers University, New Jersey

# Summary
Our project used the MIMIC Dataset to predict 30 day- critical care readmissions. The machine learning model that predicted whether a patient upon admission was at risk of readmission. This is a problem which costs Medicare $15 million dollars a year. Our results were comparable with leading reasearch papers on this topic as identified in the literature survey using Area under the ROC curve and recall as evaluation metrics.

Features deemed to be important towards the predictive power of the algorithms were: 
Hemoglobin levels
Creatinine levels
White blood cell count
Hematocrit
Heart Rate
Platelet Count
Red blood cell count
Systolic Blood Pressure
Blood Oxygen Saturation
PTT (partial thromboplastin time)

Plus two we added in: 
Is the admission a readmission?
Number of disease categories involved in patient diagnosis (based on ICD- 9 Codes)
